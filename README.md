## Spotify PlayList

A project where you can create a playlist that you love and add songs to your playlist in a just a click.

With this python script you can time travel to your desired date or season that matters most to you.
For example if you want to know the top songs at a specific date or maybe a memory you want to bring back, all you need is to `input the date` and you have all the favorite songs of that time in a playlist created for you by this script in your speotify account and you enjoy it.

Follow these steps to set up the python script with your spotify account.

  * And Save
We are done with the spotify developer App

To make your environmental variables recognized or read by the script.
Inside your working directory
We need to install all the modules needed for this script
  * Cpy each of these commands and run it to install the modules
```bash
pip3 install python-dotenv
```
```bash
pip3 install bs4
```
```bash
pip3 install requests
```
```bash
pip3 install spotipy
```


We are all set to test our script!!!
After all the above the steps are completed.
Run the `main.py` file

If everything is fine, you will be prompted to input the date you want to check the top 100 songs on that date.

Date format:
```bash
YYYY-MM-DD
```
Example below:
![Screenshot 2022-10-31 at 17 26 17](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81332784/199430202-a141a0b7-9861-4707-b6d8-eacc1224c626.png)


If a song is not found in Spotify , the name of the song will be logged in the console like above.
Check your Spotify and you will find your playlist created and top100 songs added in the playlist.
Like below:
![Screenshot 2022-10-31 at 17 28 54](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81332784/199430269-cc3620b7-4586-4f86-bd55-0b4a0ad9b995.png)


The songs are 99 because 1 song wasn't found in Spotify.

Also if you try same date without Renaming the previous playlist with same Date, you can't have multiple playlists with the same name and same songs.
You will be notified in console like below:
